# KRTSPServer
this RTSP server is on the Linux kernel space. this is a gadget.

it based on the "https://sourceforge.net/projects/krtspproxyd/".

the original version is based on the Linux kernel 2.6.x, so I will port and program to the Linux kernel 5.x.

Maybe I will install to the raspberry pi 3b.
