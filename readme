1. Introduction
---------------
   kRtspProxyd is a kernel-level Rtsp/Rtp proxy daemon, which can be deployed between 
   streaming servers on the Internet and clients in LAN  to make the streaming resources 
   available to the clients who cannot access them directly. The next step is to implement 
   caching function based on the existing proxy system. 
   
2. How to Start  
--------------
   0) confirm that your machine is running with Linux kernel 2.4.20 or upper  
   1) compile and load the module
   2) configure the module in /proc/sys/net/krtsproxyd if needed
   3) echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/krtsproxyd/start

   unloading:
 
   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/krtsproxyd/stop
   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/krtsproxyd/unload 
   rmmod krtspproxyd
   
3. Configuration 
----------------

   1) Install and configure the streaming server and the video player
       (Darwing Streaming Server and QuickTime player is recommondated and you can download 
        them on the Apple's website easily if you can apply to the license of Apple. After the setup, you should config QuickTime player to make sure
        the proxy server address is configured exactly and the proxy port is 554)

   2) Install kRtspProxyd in the machine which is chosen to be the proxy server and config it exactly
      
   3) Open a clip in the QuickTime player(using IP address rather than domamename) to try the kernel-level proxy.

4. Parameters
-------------
   The following parameters are settable through /proc/sys/net/krtsproxyd:
 
	Name		Default		Description

       serverip         #            The IP address of the proxy server
       
	serverport	554		The port where kRtspProxyd listens on


	threads		1		The number of server-threads. Basically, the number of 
	                                   CPUs you machine has decides the value of this parameter

	documentroot	/var/cache-root	the directory where the
					caching files are---Keep for future use!

	start		0		Set to 1 to start kRtspProxyd 
					(this also resets "stop" to 0)

	stop		0		Set to 1 to stop kRtspProxyd
					(this also resets "start" to 0)

	unload		0		Set to 1 to prepare kRtspProxyd for
					unloading of the module
	
	maxconnect	50		Maximum number of concurrent
